## About Me
  
I am a third year graduate student at the University of Washington's [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/students/graduate-program/meet-our-graduate-students/) in Seattle, WA. I work as a member of the [Wood Lab](https://chelsealwood.com/people/) under the guidance of Dr. Chelsea Wood where we study historical parasite ecology in aquatic systems around the world. 
  
For my dissertation work I am focused on understanding how wildlife parasites are affected by extreme weather events and climate change. I currently am conducting projects on the parasites of marine mammals, freshwater fishes, and terrestrial birds across a range of ecosystems. 

#### Freshwater Fish

In the summer of 2024, myself and a team of 8 others from the University of Washington, the University of South Carolina, Tuskeegee University, and Valdosta State University traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana to work with the [Royal D. Suttkus Fish Collection](https://www.tubri.org/fishes/) housed at Tulane University's Biodiversity Research Institute (TUBRI). We dissected 1,118 fish over the course of 3 months and identified over 36,000 individual parasites. These data are currently being analyzed in relation to extreme weather events that affected the Pearl River ecosystem between 1963 and 2005, including 25 hurricanes, with the ultimate goal of determining the effect of such storms on parasite biodiversity and abundance in freshwater fishes. You can learn more about the larger project and how our lab's scientists study the effects of urbanization and pollution on parasite populations [here](https://chelsealwood.com/research/historical-parasite-ecology/). 

Using the data we collected from TUBRI in 2025, I am currently analyzing the effect of hurricanes on parasite abundances in riverine fish. We have preliminary found that the impact of hurricanes depends on the type of parasite involved, with some parasites being negatively affected by hurricanes and some being unaffected. We also identified seasonal declines in parasite abundance across most parasite types studied. These data are being presented for the first time at the annual meeting of the [Wildlife Disease Association](https://wda2025.com/) in Victoria, BC, Canada. Stay tuned for the paper!

In the summer of 2025, our team spent 10 weeks working with another collection of museum specimens taken from the Rio Grande River in New Mexico between 1938 and 2010. These specimens are held at the University of New Mexico's Museum of Southwestern Biology. We dissected out around 1000 fish and identified all parasites we found, in an effort to understand largely how urbanization affect parasite populations through time. This work is in collaboration with undergraduate students from New Mexico State University, Neumann University, and the University of Washington. 

#### Marine Mammals

Myself along with a team of 19 undergraduate volunteers dissect marine mammal (mainly harbor seal and harbor porpoise) GI tracts to detect, identify, and quantify parasitic burden therein. We conducted our dissections at the [Burke Museum](https://www.burkemuseum.org/) during the academic year and to date have dissected over 50 GI tracts. These data will be used to inform how parasites affect metabolic output of their hosts, as well as providing new insights into marine mammal parasitism rates and diversity. We are also working with a team of scientists from the [Prugh Lab](https://www.prughlab.com/) in the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences at the University of Washington to develop a method for more accurately sub-setting parasite samples for quantification.

## Parasite Playlist

I am curating a playlist of songs that center around parasites, or mention parasites in some meaningful way. The playlist can be viewed [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4CnFjlkRKTcFIYgf7cI5BN?si=2f29b9bf72b647a0), and if you can think of any other great parasite songs, send me an email and I will add them! 

## What Parasite Are You?

Our lab built a fun quiz where you can determine what kind of parasite you are. Designed for people of all ages, you can access the quiz at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OBSmK1hU4c1HcKWJwtMrEzHIt82Y6JgtThMoVz2-xrE/edit#slide=id.p).
